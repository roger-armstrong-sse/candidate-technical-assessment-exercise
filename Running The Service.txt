RUNNING THE CONTACT SERVICE

To start up a local instance of the service, have Tomcat running on port 8080 and navigate to 
http://localhost:8080/ContactSearchServiceClient/sampleContactServiceImplProxy/TestClient.jsp to see the client
test wrapper around the service.

NOTE: This implementation connects to an empty database, so no records will be retrieved. It is assumed that in a 
real-world scenario, an implementation of the ContactDataService interface will be provided such that live data can
be queried. See "Testing The Service" for instructions on how to test with data.
